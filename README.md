## Overview


## Business Problem
The NFL Combine is an annual event where teams scout promising players. The players complete tests of their athleticism as well as drills specific to the position they play. NFL teams use the results of the Combine along with other criteria to decide which players they will select in the NFL Draft in which teams take turns selecting players.

The goal of this project is to create a model that can be used to predict whether a player will get drafted based on their performance at the Combine. An NFL team could use such a model to determine how likely it is that a given player will be drafted by another team. Using this information, the team can adjust their draft strategy. For example, if a team wants to draft a specific player and the model says that player will not get drafted, then the team knows they can use a later pick or possibly sign the player as an undrafted free agent. On the other hand, if the model predicts that the player will be drafted, then the team will need to use an earlier pick to select that player so that another team does not select them first.

## Stakeholder Audience
The audience for this project would be scouts, managers, and coaches of NFL teams who want to improve their ability to prioritize players in the NFL Draft.
